ALGORITHM:
write an algorithm that calculate the sum of two numbers and put the result in a another number.

Answer: 
declare: a, b as numerical variables that will store the input of the users.
declare: c as a numerical variable tha will store the result of the sum.
create a text field that will ask the user to input his desire number
print: ("please enter the first number a:") 
a receives the value of standard input
print: ("please enter the second number b:")
b receives the value of standard input
this is the part that does the sum of a and b 
A + B = C
create a text field that will display the result wich is C
print: ("The result of your inputs is: c")
